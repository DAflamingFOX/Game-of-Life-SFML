3. If you use Linux, install SFML's dependencies using your system package manager. A list of dependencies can be found [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/3.0/getting-started/cmake/)

4. Configure and build your project. Most popular IDEs support CMake projects with very little effort on your part.

   - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) via the [CMake extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux)
   - [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170)
   - [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/features/cmake-support.html)
   - [Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html)

   Using CMake from the command line is straightforward as well.
   Be sure to run these commands in the root directory of the project you just created.

   ```
   cmake -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```
